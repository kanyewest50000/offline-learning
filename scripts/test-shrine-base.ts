// Shrine.BASE — where the shrine looks for its own files.
//
// The artwork, Tung's originals and the 830 vendored games are repo files, and
// every module that builds one of those URLs resolves it against Shrine.BASE.
// Served from our own pages that is the page's folder, which is what it has
// always been. Pasted into somebody else's page by embed/shrine.js it is set
// to our Pages URL instead, because location.href is then their host, where
// none of these files exist — and a catalog quietly resolving 777 entries onto
// a stranger's domain is the failure this base exists to prevent.
//
// So: the default must not move (case A), the override must be obeyed (B, C, D),
// and the modules must still load without config.js (E) — which the tests in
// this directory do, with a stub Shrine that has only LBL on it.
