/* ==========================================================================
   Shrine of Tung — standalone embed
   The whole shrine from one script tag, with no decoy site and no checkout:

     <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/kanyewest50000/offline-learning@main/embed/shrine.js"></script>

   Paste that into Replit, w3schools, a CodePen, any page that runs a script,
   and the shrine takes the page over. Roughly 90KB gzipped arrives from the
   CDN; this file is the only thing you have to copy.

   Two hosts are in play and they are not interchangeable:

     the CODE   the eight shrine modules, .js, and jsDelivr serves those with
                the right content-type. That is what this file fetches.
     the FILES  the artwork, Tung's originals and the 830 vendored games, all
                .html and .png, which have to come from GitHub Pages. jsDelivr
                serves .html from /gh/ as text/plain, so a game loaded from it
                would arrive as its own source code rather than render.

   window.SHRINE_BASE is what keeps the second one straight: config.js resolves
   every repo path against it instead of against the page, so the shrine can be
   pasted onto any host and still find its files. Set it before the modules.
